        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mario Lopez, I am currently taking CIS 162 and CIS 181  both at Cerritos College. I am currently in between jobs, but I was most recently working as a pharmacy technician at City of Hope. I am trying to learn coding in order to start a new career path, hopefully.
            This is not my first online course, but it is the first online course that I've taken that is synchronous.
            I currently have my Associate's Degree and am taking CIS courses to eventually tranfer out.
        </p>
        <h2>When I have free time I like to:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Work out</li>
            <li>Spend time with my son</li>
            <li>Scroll through memes</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My favorite website is <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> because it's easily accessible whenever someone mentions a new term, place, or event that I have no knowledge of and I can easily find a quick summary or definition.</p>
